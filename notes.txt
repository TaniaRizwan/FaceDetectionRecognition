 scaleFactor: A smaller scale factor (like 1.05) means more scales to check, which can improve accuracy but will slow down the process. A larger scale factor (like 1.3) will speed up detection but might miss some objects.

 minNeighbors: This determines how many neighbors each detected rectangle should have. A higher value (like 7) reduces false positives but might miss some faces. A lower value (like 3) increases the chances of detecting a face but also the likelihood of false positives.
 minSize: This sets the minimum size of detected objects. If youâ€™re only interested in detecting large faces, you can increase this value to speed up the process.
